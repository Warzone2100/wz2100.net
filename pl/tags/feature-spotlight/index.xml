Spectators can: Watch a multiplayer game live* See the entire map Chat with other spectators (but not with players) Use the special specstats chat command to open a special statistics view Re-watch a locally-saved replay of the game later *Note: The game does not wait on spectators, once started, so if a spectator’s connection to the host is poor they may have a sub-par live viewing experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
