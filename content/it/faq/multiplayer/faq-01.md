Entrare nelle partite esistenti di solito è facile.

Start the game, click Multi Player → Join Game → Lobby.

If any games are available, you will be able to click and join. Then tick the "ready" box. When everybody checks “ready", the game starts.

Don't forget to choose your name by clicking on the name box on the left.
