### What information do we collect?

#### Personal information you disclose to us
We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

#### Information automatically collected
Some information — such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our sites / services.

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

### Retention of information
We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested services, to maintain the security and operation of the services, and for other legitimate business purposes. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

### Display / sharing of information
We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law. In some cases, you may use our services (like communication channels / forums) to communicate with others or to display information publicly - we encourage you to consider carefully before communicating any personally identifying information, especially in a setting in which it will be displayed publicly.

### External sites
Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.
