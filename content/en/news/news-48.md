20 years ago today, on June 11, 2005, version 0.1 of the open source "Warzone 2100 Project" was released, thanks to a dedicated team of fans and volunteers.

Many years of work, and a lot of contributions, have now culminated in another big moment:

**Warzone 2100 Web Edition is now available: https://play.wz2100.net**

Play Warzone 2100 on pretty much _any device with a modern web browser_ (which supports modern WebAssembly and WebGL 2) and a big enough screen.

The core Warzone 2100 single-player experience, including the original campaign and skirmish, is now available in even more places.

Of course, **[the full download is still available]({{< ref "/" >}})**, and offers numerous advantages such as:
- Higher-quality remastered graphics
- Online multiplayer
- Better performance
- Addons, mods, and much more

But with this first Web Edition release, it becomes even easier to play on even more devices. (Yes, that includes **iPads** and **Android tablets**!)

**[Check it out!](https://play.wz2100.net)**
