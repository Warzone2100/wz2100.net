With almost **700 commits** since the last release, itâ€™s time for Warzone 2100 v**4.4**!

This release includes a brand-new "High Quality" terrain mode, an option to use "Classic" terrain, Group-management UI, "Quick Chat", Team Strategy planning, options for handling player resources on leave in multiplayer, numerous graphics and performance improvements (on supported systems), and more!

**With this release, the minimum requirements for running Warzone 2100 have changed to:**
- **OpenGL 3.0+** (from: OpenGL 2.1+)
- **OpenGL ES 3.0+** (from: OpenGL ES 2.0+)
- **Vulkan 1.0+** (unchanged)

#### 4.4 General Highlights:

- **New Terrain Renderer**
  - **New High-Quality terrain** with bump + specular mapping (from MaNGusT-)
  - "Normal" terrain (the default for more than a decade)
  - **Classic terrain** (get the truly classic look back!)
- **Instanced Rendering Support**
  - Performance improvements on supported systems
- **Initial Cascaded Shadow Mapping Support**
  - Quality and performance improvements on supported systems
- **Major improvements for classic model geometry & transparency issues** (with huge thanks to MaNGusT-)
- **Add: Groups UI menu for group management**
- Add: New repair droid suborder in the right-click menu to control if they accept retreating units (defaults to off)
- Change: Make artillery units gain commander bonuses, mimic the commander's orders, and take up slots in the commander's group
- Change: Make sensors follow the Commander thresholds again for rank
- Change: Increase minimum vertical ascension speed for slower VTOLs
- Change: Allow EMP weapon subclasses to do actual damage, add new stat "empRadius" to determine the EMP effect area rather than using the splash radius
- Fix: Properly update obstacle maps for allies
- Fix: Allied repair not working
- Fix: Improve scrolling in high FPS situations
- Fix: Prevent droids from sometimes moving towards and ramming into targets
- Fix: Mouse cursor not properly displaying or appearing in some cases
- Fix: Improve the VTOL Strike / CB rearming behavior
- Fix: Hotkeys not working after switching keyboard layout
- And many other bug & crash fixes

Multiplayer Highlights:

- **New Options for Handling Player Resources on Leave**
  - "**Distribute to Team**" - evenly splits the departing player's resources among any remaining team members
  - "**Destroy (Classic)**" - the classic behavior (all resources are destroyed when a player leaves)
- **New Pre-Game ("Waiting for Players") Screen**
  - Better view of player / spectator loading status + animated count-down
- **Add Team Strategy View**
  - Team Strategy enables sharing with your (human) teammates your plans for research and unit types (without language barriers)
  - Available via both pre-game Team Planning time (if in a game with human teams) and in-game via the Intelligence screen
- **Add "Quick Chat" in Lobby and In-game**
  - Quick Chat provides a series of categorized chat messages / phrases which can be easily sent with either one click (or via quick keyboard commands)
  - Quick Chat messages are automatically displayed in the receiver's language, and thus (once translations are updated) also provide an ability to bridge language / communication barriers
  - Quick Chat "Team" messages are sent via secured net messages between teammates
- Change: Allow demolishing departed ally structures
- Fix: Possible desync at game end (due to endconditions.js issue)
- Fix: Default name "Commander" overriding player names on exit, leave, kick etc.

Campaign Highlights:

- Numerous fixes and improvements for many levels including: Alpha 5, Alpha 6, Alpha 8, Beta 1, Beta 8, Beta End, Gamma 1, Gamma 3, Gamma 7
- Change: Use a randomized assortment of the best design components for Beta/Gamma 1 if coming from the main menu
- Change: Let research upgrade the mobile repair turret, set it to a baseline of half the repair facility
- Fix: Fix saved coordinates for newly produced units inside transporters causing units to appear in a corner coming back offworld
- Fix: Show reinforcement timer for offworld missions after the first exit rather than immediately at mission start if they're available at the start
- Fix: Cancel in-progress/held research inside labs when changing campaigns so research results don't disappear upon transitions
- Fix: libcampaign's camSetVtolSpawnState() when the stop object label is passed so that all spawners tied to the object get deactivated and not the first one encountered
- Fix: Transporters that dropped off units on Beta/Gamma 1, and are still flying back to go off map, would persist through the end of the mission and cause an unavoidable early exit trigger to load the next mission
