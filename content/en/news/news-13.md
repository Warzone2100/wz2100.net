With the help of many bug reporters & contributors, we're happy to announce the release of **4.1.1**, a bug-fix release.

Including fixes for:
- Respecting Hold & Fire At Will better
- Structure limits screen lighting
- Using faction models for UI buttons
- Chat cursor position
- Beta campaign balance tweaks
- Compilation / compatibility issues

And a number of balance tweaks:
- Make Heavy Plasma Launcher more useful with an "all rounder" role and reduce price of Plasma Cannon significantly (PR [#2009](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/pull/2009))
- Tweak mortar research paths to decouple Bombard / Pepperpot from damage / ROF upgrades and Incendiary Mortar and reduce Pepperpot weight (PR [#2021](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/pull/2021))
- Rebalance HVC and HVC Cyborg to have more ROF and 1 tile less range (PR [#2022](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/pull/2022))
