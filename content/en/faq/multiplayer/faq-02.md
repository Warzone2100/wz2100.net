If it you can't join a game that you see, check the following:

1. You need to have exactly same version of the game to join. You shouldn't have a problem if you are using the latest stable version, or probably the latest development version if it's currently officially available.

2. You need to have no mods installed, unless you are joining a modded game. Map-mods are usually ok to have.

3. Some games are protected with a password. You will not be able to join them unless you are invited.

The game uses outgoing port `2100` to connect the host and outgoing port `9990` to retrieve the list of games.
