The campaign videos must be downloaded.

If you're using the Windows installers, there is an option you can check during install to do this automatically.

For other platforms, please download the desired quality `sequences.wz` file below, and place in Warzone 2100's **configuration directory**:

- [High Quality](https://sourceforge.net/projects/warzone2100/files/warzone2100/Videos/high-quality-en/sequences.wz/download) (965 MB)
- [Standard Quality](https://sourceforge.net/projects/warzone2100/files/warzone2100/Videos/standard-quality-en/sequences.wz/download) (572 MB)
- [Low Quality](https://sourceforge.net/projects/warzone2100/files/warzone2100/Videos/low-quality-en/sequences.wz/download) (170 MB)
