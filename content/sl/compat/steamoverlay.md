#### Why canâ€™t you fix the issues with Steam?

The version of Warzone 2100 on Steam was _not_ published by the Warzone 2100 Project, nor any of the actual developers or contributors to the open source game.

It was published by an unaffiliated third-party.

As such, neither the Warzone 2100 Project nor any of the developers or contributors have any ability to maintain or update the Steam page / published builds. We cannot guarantee the authenticity or safety of the files the third-party chooses to publish, nor can we fix any issues.

(As we have in other cases, attempts were made to contact the individual behind the Steam publishing to collaborate and resolve concerns. Unfortunately, these offers to collaborate were rebuffed.)

**This is why we generally encourage getting the latest version of the game from the options listed on the [official site](https://wz2100.net).**

(If you are on Windows 10+, [the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MW0Z4MPCS8C) is a great option, and supports automatic updates.)

#### How can I disable the Steam overlay?

You can either disable it for all games (although this may be undesirable), or disable it for just Warzone 2100.

To disable the Steam overlay for a specific game:
1. Right click on the specific game (ex. "Warzone 2100") in your Steam library
2. Choose "Properties"
3. Under "General", ensure the checkbox for "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game" is _unchecked_

However, we recommend that you consider getting an official distribution from https://wz2100.net instead. This is the only way to ensure that you get the latest fixes and improvements in a timely manner, and can play multiplayer without disruption.
